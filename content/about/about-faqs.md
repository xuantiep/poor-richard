**Q: What is Spotlight PA?**

**A:** Spotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan and statewide newsroom dedicated to producing investigative journalism about Pennsylvania government — with a particular focus on how it's spending your tax dollars — and significant statewide issues that matter to communities in all corners of the state. The project is led by [The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com) in partnership with [PennLive/The Patriot-News](https://www.pennlive.com), [TribLIVE/Pittsburgh Tribune Review](https://www.triblive.com) and [WITF Public Media](https://www.witf.org).

**Q: What is Spotlight PA’s mission?**

**A:** The [mission of Spotlight PA](https://lesspage.com/about/) is to hold powerful private and public forces in Pennsylvania — especially governments, businesses and special interests — to account through urgent and compelling investigative journalism that drives change and strengthens our democracy, the state and all who live here.

**Q: Why was Spotlight PA created?**

**A:** Aggressive reporting on Pennsylvania’s state government has withered as newsrooms have faced financial pressure and cut back on coverage. With its team of seven talented reporters, Spotlight PA is the single largest expansion of the statehouse reporting corps in recent history.

**Q: What does Spotlight PA cover?**

**A:** Spotlight PA’s reporters are assigned to cover the state government’s many departments, agencies and commissions, as well as significant local and regional issues that cut across political and geographic boundaries. Their goal is to produce digital-first journalism that drives change.

**Q: Why should I support Spotlight PA?**

**A:** High-quality investigative and accountability journalism takes a lot of time and resources, and it’s critical to holding our elected officials and those in power responsible for their actions. Too often, however, it’s pushed aside because of financial struggles and budgetary constraints. We aim to fill the void in a bold way, but we need your support to keep doing this important work.

**Q: How do I support Spotlight PA?**

**Q: What is "digital-first journalism"?**

**A:** Digital-first journalism means we make all of our editorial decisions based on the best way to reach modern-day readers online and in the forms and formats they like most for consuming news. While some of our stories will take the traditional, narrative form, we'll seek to innovate using data and visual tools to create new, interesting and engaging storytelling forms. And we won't be afraid to experiment.

**Q: How does Spotlight PA measure its success?**

**A:** Spotlight PA measures success based on its ability to produce original accountability journalism, engage readers and communities across the state — especially in areas underserved by the media — spark conversation and drive meaningful change.

**Q: What makes Spotlight PA different from other news organizations?**

**A:** Spotlight PA is the largest newsroom dedicated to covering the state government and significant statewide issues, and the only newsroom in the state focused solely on investigative and accountability reporting. We are grant-funded, and that allows us to make all of our decisions based on the best way to inform  and engage you, our reader, as opposed to page views, visitors, ad impressions or other business-related metrics.
